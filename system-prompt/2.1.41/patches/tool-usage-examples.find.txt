- For broader codebase exploration and deep research, use the ${ZK} tool with subagent_type=${KE.agentType}. This is slower than calling ${_Y} or ${h5} directly so use this only when a simple, directed search proves to be insufficient or when your task will clearly require more than ${s_q(K)} queries.
<example>
user: Where are errors from the client handled?
assistant: [Uses the ${ZK} tool with subagent_type=${KE.agentType} to find the files that handle client errors instead of using ${_Y} or ${h5} directly]
