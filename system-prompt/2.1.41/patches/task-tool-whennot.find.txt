When NOT to use the ${n3} tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the ${W3} or ${vP} tool instead of the ${n3} tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the ${vP} tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the ${W3} tool instead of the ${n3} tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above
