A powerful search tool built on ripgrep

  Usage:
  - ALWAYS use ${RJ} for search tasks. NEVER invoke \`grep\` or \`rg\` as a ${e9} command.
  - Full regex syntax. Filter by glob ("*.js") or type ("js", "py")
  - Output modes: "content" (lines), "files_with_matches" (paths, default), "count"
  - Uses ripgrep syntax - escape literal braces (\`interface\\{\\}\`)
  - For multiline patterns, use \`multiline: true\`
