I was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1pw14hj/claude_helped_me_get_a_full_time_job/) that mentioned they got a full-time job using Claude Code, and I wanted to share my story here too, just in case I can hopefully inspire someone.

A few months ago, a company in San Francisco reached out to me on LinkedIn. I had an initial screening call with them and went through the rest of their interview process over a month or so. Throughout the whole process, Claude Code was the thing that helped me the most.

I first used it for initial research. I gave the URL of the company's website to Claude Code so it could look through it and summarize what it found. I asked it to do web searches for research. I also asked it to look through their open source repo so I could understand their tech better.

After the initial few calls, they asked me to do a task that I wasn't that familiar with. It was basically a data engineering task, and I was never a data engineer. It was also supposed to be AI-heavy, and while I had worked with AI before, I hadn't worked with the specific model that would be the best for this task, specifically CLIP. I was kind of stumped, and I only had a few days to prepare.

But I thought, okay, let's give Claude Code this task and see what I can do with it. I worked with it using a voice transcription system, going back and forth. I had a lot of bugs in my code, but eventually I was able to get through everything. At the end of the day, they were impressed with my project. I was kind of unsure if I could make it work in basically a day, but I was able to do that thanks to the power of Opus 4.1 at that time.

Additionally, they asked me to present a blog post I read. So I figured, okay, why not write an entire blog post just for this? I did exactly that, and they were also impressed by that.

So overall, that's pretty much how I got the job: just knowing how to use Claude Code effectively.

Since then, for the past few months, I've been using it extensively at work too. It's definitely made me a lot more efficient than I would be otherwise, and it's helped me stand out at my current job as well.
