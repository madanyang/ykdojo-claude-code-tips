# Claude Code Scripts

## context-bar.sh

A two-line status line script for Claude Code that shows model, directory, git branch, uncommitted file count, sync status with origin, context usage, and your last message.

**Example output:**
```
Opus 4.5 | 📁Daft | 🔀fix/colab-pydantic-pickle (0 files uncommitted, synced 20m ago) | █░░░░░░░░░ 12% of 200k tokens used

```

### Installation

1. Copy the script to your Claude scripts directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/scripts
   cp context-bar.sh ~/.claude/scripts/
   chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/context-bar.sh
   ```

2. Update your `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "statusLine": {
       "type": "command",
       "command": "~/.claude/scripts/context-bar.sh"
     }
   }
   ```

That's it!

### Requirements

- `jq` (for JSON parsing)
- `bash`
- `git` (optional, for branch display)
- Claude Code 2.0.65+ (verified to work; older versions may not have the required JSON fields - check earlier commits for older versions)

### How it works

Claude Code passes session metadata to status line commands via stdin as JSON, including:
- `model.display_name` - The model name
- `cwd` - Current working directory
- `context_window.total_input_tokens` - Total input tokens used
- `context_window.total_output_tokens` - Total output tokens used
- `context_window.context_window_size` - Maximum context window size
- `transcript_path` - Path to the session transcript JSONL file

The script uses these JSON fields to calculate context usage (input + output tokens), showing percentage of the context window. Use `/context` for precise token breakdown.
